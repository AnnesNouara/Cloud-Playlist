Cloud Playlist Tracker

Cloud Playlist Tracker is a backend-focused project designed to manage tracks and playlists in a structured and scalable way. The project currently focuses on building the core API using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite. It will later expand into a full-stack application with a Svelte frontend and optional user authentication.

This project demonstrates practical backend development skills, including Python API design, database modelling, validation using Pydantic, and working with relational databases.
